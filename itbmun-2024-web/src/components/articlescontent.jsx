        text: `A delegate of Turkey accused Denmark of discriminating against Muslims for banning full face garments in colleges and airports in a UN committee. Seeing as this ban reduces dishonesty and protects the rights of others however, the justness of this ban is taken into question.
  
          Denmark claims that they do not enforce these laws on muslim garments but face coverings in general to provide security in airports and to reduce cheating attempts in colleges. Similar to how negative treatment towards a specific group is frowned upon, shouldn’t positive treatment to a single one be treated the same way. Certain countries who have been the victim of many attacks from a particular religion have enforced laws such as laicité to protect their secularism. 
          
          The most extreme precautions mostly seem to have sprung up after the tragic 9/11 incident. While it is true that these Islamic terrorists claim that this attack was for an Islamic cause, Islamic countries were also caught in the crossfire and received damages. The Indonesian, Syrian, and Arab Saudi delegates all revealed in an interview that this attack had more negatively impacted their countries. The muslim majority were given a negative stigma by the general public.
          
          A Syrian delegate reveals in an interview his concern of the fallacious stigma the public now holds which falls into what he thinks is ad hominem( Ad hominem fallacy (or ad hominem) is an attempt to discredit someone’s argument by personally attacking them.). Syria gives its reasons against blanket freedom of speech, which the Islamic governments think will stir up conflict they’re desperately trying to prevent. 
          
          Perhaps it is derogatory and discriminative to take precautions against a group of people, or it might simply be the human nature of pattern recognition. If some laws created are offensive to some religions, do their rights to be offended trump a writer's right to give his opinion, or a government’s rights to protect its nation? As the United Nations Human Rights council committee progresses we will learn more of the conclusions to these questions. In the next few hours,the committee will soon be taking steps to agree on a specific resolution.

          During the first committee session the council rushed to explore solutions upon the topic due to the time limitation. The delegate of Norway describes it as “not necessary, at all”, therefore he has taken the flow of the council into his hands. As the second committee session began, it was established by both Norway and Cambodia that the council should first take a meticulous approach in analyzing the situation as a whole, before diving in such solutions.
  
          “We need to address the very nature of the problem before we can even think about passing solutions, because that’s what our solutions entail,” states the delegate of Norway. Members of the council supported this strategy, and discussions regarding the root causes, repercussions, and cultural differences started to spark. However it is evident that delegates appear to be redundant, whereas China and USA provide a different light to such subtopics.
  
          The delegate of the USA strongly believes that the council is looking at the situation with a broad point of view, preferring to alter the perspective. Moving forward to the introduction of solutions, the delegate suggests several intricate strategies that revolve around the involvement of the local community, as she believes that in order to solve a problem that has spiraled around the globe, it is important to first tackle the issues that began it.
          
          “This very issue is occurring today among the people, in communities all over the world. What is happening among people, can be fixed by people. This problem is not only the responsibility of big organizations and the government; citizens can also make a change,” expressed by the delegate of the USA.
  
          Though Norway’s and USA’s contribution towards the United Nation Office on Drugs and Crime has set the council on a steady path to a unified resolution, it is mandatory for everyone to address the reintegration of victims to society, victim care and protection, and prevention.`,

        text: `(CNN)-- ILO estimated that roughly 1.2 up to 2 million juveniles are affected by child sexual exploitation, human trafficking, and child sex tourism each year.  The biggest case is in Cambodia where in 2005, 800.000 of sex workers were minors. Other than South East Asia, the problem is prevalent in areas where traveling is cheap. 
          
          There are multitudes on why such horrific things still happened. However, the biggest factors are just two, poverty and the demand by, to put it mildly, pedophiles. 
          
          In developing economies, informal economies comprised a significant amount of said economies GDP. On average, it represents 35 percent of GDP in low- and middle- income countries. Child sex tourism is a large part of the informal economy in many countries and it has become a source of employment and income. In particular segments of society, it’s the only way to meet their economic needs.
          
          Besides that, the demand for child sexual exploitation is still ongoing.  Not only that, social media causes a much wider propagation of child pornography to be viewed. However, there is a bigger concern, regarding not those who preferred children, but people who are offered child prostitutes who are not specifically preferred to them. The reason for concern is that they are implicit and actively being ignorant towards the issue of child sexual exploitation.
          
          The immediate cost for child sexual exploitation is clearly on the kids themselves. They suffered trauma and medical complications. Additionally, it can cause further problems in the future such as substance abuse, binge eating, alcoholism and suicide. Besides that, when a nation is found to be complicit in a child sexual exploitation case, not only it can harm a country’s reputation, but it could end up affecting its national income due to the pushing away of foreign tourists, which is a source of foreign revenue and affects foreign investment especially for developing countries.

        text: `Realistically, how could we prevent child sexual exploitation from happening? Well, some argued for harsher penalties and better supervision. Others also argued for education and by raising awareness. But there is one solution that hasn’t been discussed at all, the decriminalization of sex work.
          
         Keep in mind, this is not a justification for child sex exploitation. Sex work is not the same as sex trafficking and exploitation. Sex work is done voluntarily by adults who is doing it for a living. By decriminalizing sex work, the demand for child prostitute is diverted to more legal and adult sex work and it provides the protection of livelihood from doing sex work which can combat financial insecurity and bring stability.

        text: `But how to actually implement this decriminalization effectively? First and foremost, is reducing criminalization of sex work. Reducing criminalization of sex workers is to legalize the selling of sex, but not the purchase of it. That way, this can be the first step to identifying pedophiles. From there, law enforcement can better handle child sexual exploitation cases.
          
          Not only that, reduced criminalization can reduce the amount of child prostitutes. An example of reducing sex workers is in Sweden, where in 1999 it passed the Sex Purchase Act where the purpose was to encourage sex workers to seek help in leaving the profession safely without legal problems. Prior to the Sex Purchase Act, there were an estimated 2,500 to 3,000 sex workers in Sweden. By 2008, the numbers had dropped to around 650 sex workers. With a similar law being passed, more child prostitutes are being supported to get out of these horrific situations.
          
          Yet, reducing criminalization is not enough. Critics argued that fewer buyers meant fewer clients for those still in the industry which can cause the inability of the seller to turn down clients or negotiate safe-sex practices. Also, by criminalizing one side of the industry, it minimizes the seller’s time to assess risks, including the threat of violence. It’s not the beyond-end-all solution. That is why reducing criminalization is only the first step towards decriminalization.
          
          With pedophiles being identified and the number of sex workers itself being reduced, decriminalization is a way to legalize the minimum age for sex workers. Since the age of consent is varied by country, there couldn’t ever be a consensus regarding it. However, the age to conduct sex work can be established more in consensus. By doing that, it can minimize child prostitution to an all time low that it practically went extinct.

        text: `Total decriminalization of sex work has only been implemented by 5 countries. These include Belgium, Denmark, New Zealand, Rwanda and Spain. The best case of total decriminalization is in New Zealand where it was reported that decriminalized sex workers are safer and have more rights than sex workers did before and compared to those working elsewhere under criminalizing regimes. There, it is against the law for any third party to facilitate anyone under the age of 18 into sex work. As a result, only 210 children under 18 were identified to be involved in child prostitution. It may seem like a huge number, but it’s way ahead of many nations, including developed ones like the United States and Australia.
          
          However, can such solutions be actively done by all the nations in the world? And can all the nations do decriminalization as well as New Zealand? Realistically, an absolute no, especially when we are living in a world which consists of different moral standards. However, with some countries already doing either one of the solutions, it shows that it can be done. And in the case of New Zealand, a model and guideline to practically solve the problem. It’s just the question of how many other countries will follow suit?

Thus far they affirm their stance in being open minded in the proposed solution as long as the target is achieved.  
  
          “We are strengthening the belt on the road to peace,” assures the delegate of China. 
          
          Despite their neutrality they have been enthusiastic in designing a working paper that revolves on the basis of human, secure, and stable resolution. Majority of the council also supports this stance, yet China has trouble recruiting members to their bloc. 
          
          The United Kingdom, an observant delegate, has mentioned their hesitation to collaborate with China is because of the lack of detail in their plan, leading to uncertainty. Currently China is aiming to leverage Albania and France in reaching an agreement. With all the negotiations China is regulating, the guarantee of a straightforward strategy from them wavers in every conversation. 
          
          The first step to China’s proposition is to facilitate humanitarian aid in hopes to appeal to both ends of the conflict, ensuring their trust. Although due to the recent crisis, regaining such trust from the involved nations through the UN may be a road bump the council must face. 
          
          Nonetheless, they believe in a UN based solution, keeping an open mind to the involvement of regional organizations in regards to support and assurance. Secondly, China plans to “negotiate for a negotiation” to allow a ceasefire. Tensions have risen in Western Sahara for more than 15 years without a light at the end of the tunnel due to the increasing military involvement. To secure a feasible proposal in conducting a ceasefire, China aims to appease and compromise with both Morocco and the Polisario Front. 
          
          A ceasefire follows in China’s attempt to establish clear status of the Western Sahara in the case that all goes well. Then another negotiation is initiated for the final step, which is the referendum. Contents of the referendum are still being discussed as there have been numerous attempts to brokening peace with a referendum; until now the combat for African colonies has not reached its end. 
           
          Bloc 2 comprising Japan, Albania, Russia, Mozambique, United Kingdom, Gabon and Brazil have also created their own working paper that essentially circulates around the same foundation. Their plan is structured with negotiation for a ceasefire whilst humanitarian aid is both provided for the participating communities. In hopes of a successful conference, a ceasefire would play out, showing a glimpse of peace. To maintain such bliss in the African continent, a disarmament is encouraged. Both working papers still lack substance and specifications, but their path is clear.

          With that there is a preferred approach on handling the future of Western Sahara, but will accept any solution as long as the conflict can be resolved. If most delegates stick by their acclaimed neutral and open-minded stance, the reason as to why delegates refuse to merge blocs is uncertain. With a unified council more time could be allotted to the specifications of the DR rather than disagreements on the general procedures. Their concerns with placing the UN back to its former glory, analysis on previous referendums and possible solutions, and the saving people could be settled.  Additionally the formatting of the council’s final Draft Resolution could be up to par, possibly putting them at an upperhand in convincing the nations taking part in the Western Sahara conflict.

        text: `"We need to educate people on their cultural norms, and that’s bad," the delegate of Norway declared as the entire council swung their heads in agreement.
          
          The UNODC Member States held their second consecutive conference day on Saturday, June 24, with the following committee session sprawling with stronger and more compelling arguments regarding the state of child sex tourism, child pornography, and underage prostitution from a global perspective.
          
          Despite the room’s desire for a global set of universal standards, norms, and regulations concerning CST, most of the council had failed to understand the underlying value of what underage sex truly means in cultures and traditions.
          
          Underage sex, in tradition, has been shaped for centuries by the prevalent tradition of child marriage. In India, the Rabari Tribespeople of Kutsch have wed 10-year-olds in an ancestral ceremony. Adolescent marriage in Rabari is a rich and festive practice that, for them, ensures the conservation of their cultural heritage and identity.
          
          Marriage, in most cultures and religions, also acts as an authorization to allow the performance of sexual activities and intercourse. Therefore, the normalisation of underage sex, which eventually leads to prostitution, has prospered through the fundamentalism of traditions.
          
          The intention of the member states had all been in a kind manner, which was to protect children's welfare from the danger of underage prostitution. Still, the arguments about cultural norms that had been in motion had led to the promotion of using education to teach citizens to go against cultural traditions and to let them know that "It’s bad."
          
          They have failed to understand the definition of cultural norms, as in the next moderated caucus, the council continued to define and limit the term, saying that child sex tourism had resulted from generational expectations and a lack of modernity. Completely ignoring how the maintenance of this behaviour has also been for the sake of protecting heritage and cultural identity.
          
          If this ignorance continues to prevail, eventual loopholes will occur during the resolution. What could come is separatism and the marginalisation of communities deemed "backward" by the public and the UN. Education should be used not to change someone but to help them adapt. Take this opportunity to reconsider which side you’re on. The side of the impoverished, who have known underage sex as a crevice of their ancestral history, or the foreign tourists, the ones who know much better yet exploit and trigger demand for the sake of their own pleasure.
